I am a Researcher (Tenure Track) in Statistics at the Department of Economics and Finance at [LUISS](https://economiaefinanza.luiss.it) of Rome. My research interests span across Statistics and Econometrics. My research is centred on the development of Bayesian methods on two core topics: (i) complex and multidimensional data (i.e., tensors), and (ii) multivariate time series data, including discrete time series and dynamic networks.

Create content & metadata
------
Each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff.
The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
